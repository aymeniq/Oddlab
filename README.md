# Oddlab
Oddlab (Odds labels) is a modern deployable traffic engineering approach for ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of multi-rooted data center (DC) traffic in both symmetric and asymmetric modes. We used the data from the switches, such as residual bandwidth and the number of mounted flows, to create a heuristic model based on concepts to avoid bottleneck ties and reroute the trapped elephant flows in Oddlab. Our preliminary findings show that Oddlab may reduce Flow Completion Time (FCT), increase bisection bandwidth, increase network utilization, and reliably identify broken ties, all of which boost the DC's productivity.

# Implementation
Oddlab is a python program that runs on the Ryu controller and uses mininet as a real-time network emulator to construct a multi-rooted K-4 fat-tree DCN, as well as OpenFlow protocol 1.3 for communication. The testbed's topology consists of 16 hosts connected to twenty four-port OpenFlow switches, each of which is made up of four pods with four core switches. We set the link capacity through the DCN to 10 Mbps in order to maintain connection precision in the mininet's real-time setting. The controller connected to each switch in parallel to collect the network statistics needed to handle the flow scheduling operation.
