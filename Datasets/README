In Oddlab, we considered two different workloads: websearch  and cache jobs workloads [1]:  Both workloads are collected and analyzed in the Intra-Datacenter network. In the web search dataset, the distribution ratios will be as follows: 
In a web search, 33% of the data was less than 1 kilobyte, 93% was between 1 and 10 kilobytes, and the rest was between 10 and 300 kilobytes. The data size distribution for the cache workloads, 18% of the files were about 1 KB, 38% were in the range of 1–10 KB, around 40% had sizes between 100–900 KB, and the remaining files accounted for the largest sizes, ranging from 5 MB to nearly 7 MB.
