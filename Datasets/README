In Oddlab, we considered two different workloads: websearch a [1] and cache jobs [2] workloads:
In a web search, 33% of the data was less than 1 kilobyte, 93% was between 1 and 10 kilobytes, and the rest was between 10 and 300 kilobytes. The data size distribution for the cache workload was as follows: 18% of the data was less than 0.1 Kbyte, 38% was between 0.1 and 10 Kbyte, less than 90% was 1 Mbyte, and the remainder was less than 10 Mbyte.
